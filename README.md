A basic web portfolio I created for my SO, a reporter and multi-media journalist. The site was kept clean to keep the visual focus on Sharon's reels and photos. I stuck with a single parallax page, since most recruiters and employers won't be bothered to navigate through several discrete pages. 

I used Materializecss to create the carousel. I did not lean heavily on the grid functionality due to my relatively simple content, so it was only used for the contact form. One of the pitfalls of material design is that it's very easy to look generic, so I would have like to have used more cards to make content pop, like the form section.

For a future project, I think I would use a more stripped down framework like Bulma.
